# AI Usage Report

I used geneartive AI to assist with specific coding tasks during this project.
In particular, I used AI to:

- Support in generating Python code for web scraping the USA city population data
- Support in debugging code for merging datasets using pandas

All analysis, decisions and interpretation were my own.

## What worked well

- The AI hass been very helpful to adjust 'pandas.read_html()' for scraping tables from the website.
- It provided useful explanations and quick fixes for common pandass errors.

## What did not work well

- Sometimes the AI suggested DataFrame structures that did not match my dataset, so I had to correct code.

## Prompts Used

Here there are the actual prompts I used during the project:

- "What does random_state do in pandas sample?"
- "How to read a table from a website using pandas?"
- "Fix ValueError: Length mismatch in pandas when renaming columns"
- "Why do I get 'AttributeError: Can only use .str accessor with string values!'?"
